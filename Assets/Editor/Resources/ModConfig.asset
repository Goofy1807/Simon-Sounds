  title: Simon Sounds
  description: "Simon Sounds is a version of the popular Simon Says game. In this
    version you won\u2019t see which button Simon pressed, but you will hear the sound
    this particular button generates.\n\nOn the top of the module you will find 4
    sample buttons. Press them to hear the sound they generate and figure out which
    button Simon pressed.\n\nREMEMBER: The colours of the sample buttons AS WELL as
    the input buttons are messed up! \n\nCreated by Goofy in collaboration with Timwi\n\n[url=http://ktane.timwi.de/PDF/Simon%20Sounds.pdf]Manual
