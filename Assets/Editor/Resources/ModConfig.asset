  description: "Version 1.0\n\nSimon Sounds is a version of the popular Simon Says
    game. In this Version you won`t see which button Simon pressed, but you will hear
    the sound this particular button generates.\n\nOn the Top of the module you will
    find 4 Sample Buttons. Press them to hear the sound they generate and figure out
    which button Simon pressed.\n\nREMEMBER: The Colours of the sample Buttons ASWELL
    as the input buttons are messed up! \n\nCreated by Goofy"
